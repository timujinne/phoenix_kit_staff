# Test helper for PhoenixKitStaff.
#
# Level 1: Unit tests (schemas, changesets, pure functions) always run.
# Level 2: Integration tests (tagged `:integration` via PhoenixKitStaff.DataCase)
#          require PostgreSQL — automatically excluded when the database
#          is unavailable.
#
# First-time setup:
#
#   mix test.setup          # or: createdb phoenix_kit_staff_test
#
# After that, `mix test` boots the repo, runs core's versioned migrations
# via `PhoenixKit.Migration.ensure_current/2` (the V135 baseline carries the
# staff tables; V136 adds employments; later versions apply on every boot),
# and lets the Ecto sandbox handle isolation. No module-owned DDL.

# Elixir 1.19's `mix test` no longer auto-loads modules from
# `:elixirc_paths` test directories at test-helper time — only files
# matching `:test_load_filters` get loaded by the test runner. Explicit
# `Code.require_file/2` is needed before `test_helper.exs` references
# the support modules.
